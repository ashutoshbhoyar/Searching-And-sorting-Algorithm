# Searching-And-sorting-Algorithm
A basic example of a searching and sorting algorithm.

DESCRIPTION : 

Bubble sort: This algorithm compares adjacent elements in an array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues to do this until the array is sorted. Bubble sort is a simple algorithm to understand and implement, but it is not very efficient.
Selection sort: This algorithm finds the smallest element in an array and swaps it with the first element. It then finds the second smallest element and swaps it with the second element, and so on. Selection sort is also a simple algorithm to understand and implement, but it is not as efficient as bubble sort.


Insertion sort: This algorithm starts at the beginning of an array and inserts each element into its correct position in the sorted part of the array. Insertion sort is a stable algorithm, which means that it does not change the order of elements with the same value. Insertion sort is more efficient than bubble sort or selection sort for small arrays, but it is not as efficient for large arrays.



Binary search: This algorithm is used to search for a specific element in a sorted array. It starts at the middle of the array and compares the target element to the element at the middle of the array. If the target element is equal to the element at the middle of the array, then the algorithm has found the element. If the target element is smaller than the element at the middle of the array, then the algorithm recursively searches the left half of the array. If the target element is larger than the element at the middle of the array, then the algorithm recursively searches the right half of the array.


Interpolation search: This algorithm is similar to binary search, but it uses the value of the target element to estimate the position of the element in the sorted array. This can make interpolation search more efficient than binary search for some applications.


Linear search: This algorithm simply searches through an array sequentially, comparing the target element to each element in the array. Linear search is the simplest sorting algorithm, but it is not very efficient.
